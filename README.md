Designing and Building an Electric Motor Optimized for High RPM with [Ethan Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethnzhng/)

## Overview
This paper describes the design process and results of a two-phase, four pole, brushless, DC electric motor that was optimized for rotational speed (RPM). Speed optimization was primarily in the form of a robust, compact exterior for maximum stability and minimal vibrations. The motor reached a top speed of 13,140 RPM and averaged 12,120 RPM, both under 28.1 Watts of power. The static torque measured was 0.00019 N⋅m and the dynamic torque was 0.00010 N⋅m. The motor’s efficiency was only 0.163%. Despite the low torque, the high rotational speed gives this motor promise for being used as a vacuum motor (or another type of motor that relies on speed and not torque). 

## Final Results
**Top RPM:** 13,140 RPM

**Avg. RPM:** 12,120 RPM

**Static Torque:** 0.00019 N*m

**Dynamic Torque:** 0.00010 N*m
